# card-in-css
In this small project, I have made 3 div tags in which I used img tag and added man and woman icon according to holder of card. after added image in div tag, I have made heading tag h3 to insert the name of the card holder. 
after that, I have added paragraph tag p to mention the role of the card holder. All this mentioned process, I have done in anchor tag so that we can redirect to another page if we want.
